# em272-micpre

A preamp for the [stereo clippy EM272](https://micbooster.com/clippy-and-pluggy-microphones/98-clippy-stereo-em272-microphone.html) mics made by micbooster in the UK. I believe they are the same capsules used in LOM mics as well so should work with those the same. Provides plug in power and has mono/stereo inputs and outputs.

Based on this [reference design](https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/tidu765/tidu765.pdf?ts=1644907822477&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.ti.com%252Ftool%252FTIPD181) and this [thread](https://llllllll.co/t/mic-pre-a-tiny-line-level-electret-microphone-preamp-for-norns-modular-field-recording-and-whatnot/53345) on the lines forum.

Here is a [short recording](/assets/clean_uke.wav) of a cheap ukulele through the preamp.
